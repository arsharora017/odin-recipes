    <h2>Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib</h2>
    <p>
      If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a
      juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast,
      this recipe is for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best
      prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the
      formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5
      = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (4 pound) prime rib roast</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
      <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well
        blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast
        generously with kosher salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your
        roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, see footnote to calculate
        cooking time.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed,
        let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
